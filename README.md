# self-host-ai
## Self host and build AI workflows with N8ns, Ollama, Qdrant amd PostgreSQL.

### What's included

✅ [**Self-hosted n8n**](https://n8n.io/) - Low-code platform with over 400
integrations and advanced AI components

✅ [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) - Cross-platform LLM platform to install
and run the latest local LLMs

✅ [**Qdrant**](https://qdrant.tech/) - Open-source, high performance vector
store with an comprehensive API

✅ [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) -  Workhorse of the Data
Engineering world, handles large amounts of data safely.

### What you can build

⭐️ **AI Agents** for scheduling appointments

⭐️ **Summarize Company PDFs** securely without data leaks

⭐️ **Smarter Slack Bots** for enhanced company communications and IT operations

⭐️ **Private Financial Document Analysis** at minimal cost

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benwalkerdata/self-host-ai.git
cd self-hosted-ai
```

### Running n8n using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU users

```
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable
in the n8n service configuration. Update the x-n8n section in your Docker Compose file as follows:

```yaml
x-n8n: &service-n8n
  # ... other configurations ...
  environment:
    # ... other environment variables ...
    - OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434
```

Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ⚡️ Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You’ll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you’re running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you’ll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.
